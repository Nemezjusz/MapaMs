The interactive map of the AGH Student Campus was created to facilitate navigation in the often crowded MS (Miasteczko Studenckie). 
Developing this web application expanded my knowledge in various areas, including databases, servers, and websites. 
Working on this project was very beneficial for me because it not only solved a problem I faced but also taught me a lot.

## Features

MapaMs offers two main functionalities:
* Public Location
* Sending a private link

Upon entering the website, a map with markers is displayed. Our marker stands out from others with its blue color. 
We can place it anywhere and then click the Set Location button to choose one of two actions.
### Public Location

The first option is to add our location with a description to the public map, visible in the form of a distinctive red astronaut. It can be used to find friends for joint activities. After placing our marker on the map, other users can click on it to get a detailed description.

### Sending a Private Link
The second option allows generating a link with the position visible only to the generator and the people it is shared with. 
It enables easy location sharing with friends without revealing it to everyone. After generating the link, we can easily 
share it using the button that redirects us directly to Messenger.
